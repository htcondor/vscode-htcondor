    batch_name = <batch_name>

Set the batch name for this submit. The batch name is displayed by
*condor_q* **-batch**. It is intended for use by users to give
meaningful names to their jobs and to influence how *condor_q* groups
jobs for display. This value in a submit file can be overridden by
specifying the **-batch-name** argument on the *condor_submit* command
line.
