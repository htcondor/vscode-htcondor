    xen_kernel = <included | path-to-kernel>

A value of **included** specifies that the kernel is included in the
disk file. If not one of these values, then the value is a path and file
name of the kernel to be used. If a kernel file will be transferred by
HTCondor, then the value should just be the simple file name (no path
information).
