    max_retries = <integer>

The maximum number of retries allowed for this job (must be
non-negative). If the job fails (does not exit with the
**success_exit_code** exit code) it will be retried up to
**max_retries** times (unless retries are ceased because of the
**retry_until** command). If **max_retries** is not defined, and either
**retry_until** or **success_exit_code** is, the value of
`DEFAULT_JOB_MAX_RETRIES` will be used for the maximum number of
retries.

The combination of the **max_retries**, **retry_until**, and
**success_exit_code** commands causes an appropriate `OnExitRemove`
expression to be automatically generated. If retry command(s) and
**on_exit_remove** are both defined, the `OnExitRemove` expression will
be generated by OR'ing the expression specified in `OnExitRemove` and
the expression generated by the retry commands.
