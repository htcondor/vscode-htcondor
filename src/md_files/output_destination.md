    output_destination = <destination-URL>

When present, defines a URL that specifies both a plug-in and a
destination for the transfer of the entire output sandbox or a subset of
output files as specified by the submit command
**transfer_output_files** . The plug-in does the transfer of files, and
no files are sent back to the access point. The HTCondor Administrator's
manual has full details.
